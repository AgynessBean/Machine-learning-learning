# Machine-learning-learning

This repository hosts a series of small ML type of projects.

The first somewhat successfully completed project is using a hospital readmissions dataset I obtained from Kaggle. In this project, I do a bit of EDA, then work with a few ML algorithms to determine whether the patient will get readmitted, and finally try to explain how the chosen ML algorithm works. This project is somewhat successful because while all steps seem to have worked alright and give insights that were expected from a real-world dataset, the attempt to implement the SHAP values evaluation on the chosen Logistic Regression algorithm was not successful due to holes in knowledge how to use the code.

The second project is a data cleaning project using the MET dataset, also obtained from Kaggle. The dataset itself is very large, hence absent from the repository. In the cleaning project, I deal with duplicates, missing values and do some basic reformating of certain values. Everything is accompanied by a narrative.

The third project is still pending.
